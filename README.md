Micha≈Ç Getka's personal website
============================================

This repository contains my personal website source. The site is accessible on [mgetka.dev](https://mgetka.dev). The site was built to try out the GitHub pages service and have some fun with hugo. At some point, maybe I will push myself to publish some more content in this place.

The site uses [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) free tier icons, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) and [jQuery](https://jquery.com/). The landing page typing animation was inspired by [Stan Soo](https://github.com/CheeseTurtle) work contained in the [_Simple Typing Carousel_ codepen](https://codepen.io/CheeseTurtle/pen/AYJYqE). The hamburger menu (seen on mobile devices) is a magnificent work of [Mikael Ainalem](https://github.com/ainalem) shared in [_Hamburger Menu_ codepen](https://codepen.io/ainalem/pen/wvKOEMV). The site utilizes [Fira Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code) and [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) fonts.
