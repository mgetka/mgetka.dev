I had my first contact with software development back in the primary school, when I really enjoyed playing around with web development. Those were the rough times when Internet Explorer was a tyrant king of the web and _browser wars_ were our everyday life. Back then we liked to call ourselves _webmasters_ --- the magicians who were responsible for all the aspects of the web development process --- beginning from servers provisioning and configuration, ending on frontend styling and scripting. With this background, I feel fairly confident in a number of specializations that emerged in the field more recently --- mainly as a sysadmin, backend developer and frontend developer. Nevertheless, systems administration and backend development are my primary fields of expertise. Of course lots have changed from the times of _IE6_ and today I'm doing my best in keeping up with all the tools that cool kids use nowadays --- CI/CD, automatic testing and other aspects of DevOps work culture,; security engineering, containerization and distributed systems architecture patterns --- to name a few of the subjects of my interests.

In the meantime I have graduated in the field of industrial automation and robotics. Besides of having fun with the industrial robots, this gave me a solid foundations in the fields of mathematics, statistics, optimization, control theory, electronics design and embedded systems programming. In the past, this skill set allowed me to actively take part in a number of projects in the fields of space industries and computer networks on an engineering and scientific positions.

Privately, I'm a proud father of a brilliant little girl. I enjoy winter sports and assembling of _LEGO Technic_ sets. I also see myself as new technologies enthusiast and Linux fanboy --- and while writing this I cry inside a little, since those words are written on a Mac.
